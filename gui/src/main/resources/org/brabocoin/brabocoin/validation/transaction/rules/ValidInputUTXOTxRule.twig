{% extends "../../SkippedRule.twig" %}

{% block description %}
    This rule checks that the outputs referenced by the inputs of the transaction are unspent.
    This means all referenced outputs need to be present in the current UTXO set.
    If one of the transaction's referenced outputs is spent, the transaction is invalid.<br>
    <br>
    All referenced outputs are unspent: {{ inputsUnspent }}<br>
