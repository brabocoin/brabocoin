This rule checks that the transaction fee is larger than the minimum transaction fee defined in consensus.
If not, the transaction is invalid.<br>
<br>
In order to compute the transaction's fee, we need to find the referenced outputs of the inputs of the transactions, which are stored in the UTXO set at the time the block is first received.<br>
<br>
At this point in time, however, the UTXO set has (probably) changed already, which means we cannot find these referenced outputs anymore.
We can only check this rule once when the block is first received.
Therefore, this validation rule is skipped.<br>
