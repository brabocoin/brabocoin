{% block description %}
    This rule checks whether the total sum of all transaction fees in the block is within the legal money range.
    If not, the block is invalid.<br>
    <br>
    In order to compute the total sum of transaction fees, we need to calculate the fee of each invidivual transaction.
    We can only compute these if we can find the referenced outputs of the inputs of the transactions, which are stored in the UTXO set at the time the block is first received.<br>
    <br>
    At this point in time, however, the UTXO set has (probably) changed already, which means we cannot find these referenced outputs anymore.
    We can only check this rule once when the block is first received.
    Therefore, this validation rule is skipped.
