{% extends "../../SkippedRule.twig" %}

{% block description %}
    This rule checks whether the validated block is already stored in the blockchain at the moment we receive this block.
    If so, the block is invalid.<br>
    <br>
    However, we cannot check this rule at this moment anymore, because we have already received this block some time ago, and now the block is already stored.
    We can only check this rule once when the block is first received.
    Therefore, this validation rule is skipped.<br>
