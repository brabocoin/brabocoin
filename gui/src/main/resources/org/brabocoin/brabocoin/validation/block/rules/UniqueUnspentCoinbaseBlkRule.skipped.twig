{% extends "../../SkippedRule.twig" %}

{% block description %}
    This rule checks whether the coinbase transaction of the block is unique and is not already present as unspent transaction output in the UTXO set, at the moment the block was first received.
    If the coinbase transaction is not unique, the block is invalid.<br>
    <br>
    However, at this point in time we cannot check this rule anymore, because this block was first received some time ago.
    The block was therefore already validated and processed at that point, and the UTXO set has changed because of that.<br>
    <br>
    This means we cannot check this rule anymore; we can only check this rule once when the block is first received.
    Therefore, this validation rule is skipped.<br>
