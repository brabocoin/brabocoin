{% block description %}
    This rule checks that all coinbase transactions spent by this transaction's inputs have a depth larger than the coinbase maturity depth defined in consensus.
    If not, the transaction is invalid.<br>
    <br>
    All spent coinbase transactions are mature enough: <code>{{ coinbaseMature }}</code> <br>
