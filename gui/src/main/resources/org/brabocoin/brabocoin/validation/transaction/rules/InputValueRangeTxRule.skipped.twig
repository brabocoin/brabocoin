{% extends "../../Rule.twig" %}

{% block description %}
    This rule checks that the sum of all inputs in the transaction is within the allowed range.
    If not, this transaction instance is invalid.<br>
    <br>
    We need to find the referenced outputs of the inputs of the transactions, which are stored in the UTXO set at the time the transaction is first received.<br>
    <br>
    At this point in time, however, the UTXO set has (probably) changed already, which means we cannot find these referenced outputs anymore.
    We can only check this rule once when the transaction is first received.
    Therefore, this validation rule is skipped.<br>
