{% extends "../../SkippedRule.twig" %}

{% block description %}
    This rule checks that the outputs referenced by the inputs of the transaction are unspent.
    If not, the transaction is invalid.<br>
    <br>
    The inputs are unspent if their referenced outputs are present in the UTXO set.
    Note that we can only check this rule once when the block is first received.
    This is because, at this point in time, the UTXO set has (probably) changed already, which means we cannot find these referenced outputs anymore.
    Therefore, this validation rule is skipped.<br>
