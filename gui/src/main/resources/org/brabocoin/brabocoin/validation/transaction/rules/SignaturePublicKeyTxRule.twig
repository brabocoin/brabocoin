{% block description %}
    This rule checks that the signatures contain the right public key.
    Each signature belongs to a certain input in the transaction.
    The signature should contain the public key that belongs to the brabocoin address referenced by this input.
    If this is not the case for some signature, the transaction is invalid.<br>
    <br>
    Signatures contain the right key: <code>{{ validPubKeys }}</code><br>
