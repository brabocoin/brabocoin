{% extends "../../SkippedRule.twig" %}

{% block description %}
    This rule checks that all coinbase transactions spent by this transaction's inputs have a depth larger than the coinbase maturity depth defined in consensus.
    If not, the transaction is invalid.<br>
    <br>
    In order to check this, we need to find the outputs referenced by the inputs of this transaction.
    When the transaction is first received, these are all present in the UTXO set, which means they are easy to find.<br>
    <br>
    At this point in time, however, the UTXO set might have changed already, which means we cannot find all spent outputs anymore.
    This means we cannot check this rule anymore, and therefore, the validation rule is skipped.<br>
