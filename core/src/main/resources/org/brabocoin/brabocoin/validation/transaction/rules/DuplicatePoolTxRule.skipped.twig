This rule checks whether the transaction pool does not already contain this transaction.
If so, this transaction instance is invalid.<br>
<br>
Note that we can only check this rule once, when the transaction is first received.
After that, the transaction is stored in the transaction pool, and we cannot check this rule anymore.
Therefore, this validation rule is skipped.<br>
