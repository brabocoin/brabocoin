 This rule checks each transaction in the block via a number of transaction rules.
 All these rules are contextual, meaning they can only be validated once, at the moment the block was first received.<br>

 This means we cannot check this rule anymore at this time, because we have already received this block some time ago.
 Therefore, this validation rule is skipped.<br>
