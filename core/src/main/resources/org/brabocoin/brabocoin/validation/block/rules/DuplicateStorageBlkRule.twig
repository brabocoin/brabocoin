 This rule checks whether the validated block is already stored in the blockchain at the moment we receive this block.
 If so, the block is invalid and should be rejected.
 However, we cannot check this rule anymore, because we have already received this block some time ago.
 Therefore, this validation rule is skipped.<br>
